# Udacity_Data_Analyst_Nanodegree

This repository contains projects for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

### 1. [Anayzing Bay Area Bike Data](https://github.com/homagnibhatt/Udacity_Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/tree/master/Project_1_Analyze_Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Data)

For this initial project, a raw dataset is investigated, and findings are shared using a Jupyter Notebook. The test dataset is the real data provided by Bay Area Bike Share and the objctive of the project is to determine differences in usage between commuters and tourists ridership patterns, average duration of trips, and more.

### 2. [Testing a Perpetual phenomenon](https://github.com/homagnibhatt/Udacity_Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/tree/master/Project_2_Test_a_Perceptual_Phenomenon)

In this project, wer will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. We will  create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task and then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, we will interpret the results in terms of the hypotheses.

### 3. [Indentifying survival factors of Titanic disaster](https://github.com/homagnibhatt/Udacity_Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/tree/master/Project_3_Titanic_Data_analysis)

In this project, we will analyze the Titanic dataset and then  use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to determine the reasons of the survivors of the Titanic disaster.

### 4. [Wrangling OpenstreetMap Data](https://github.com/homagnibhatt/Udacity_Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/tree/master/Project_4_Wrangling_OpenstreetMap_Data)

This project involves Data Wrangling Openstreet map data using MongoDB to clean the data and incorporate required changes.

### 5. [Explore and Summarise Data](https://github.com/homagnibhatt/Udacity_Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/tree/master/Project_5_Explore_and_Summarise_Data)

Using R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in the Prosper loan database in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

### 6. [Identify Fraud from Enron Email](https://github.com/homagnibhatt/Udacity_Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/tree/master/Project_6_Enron_Email_fraud)

In this project, we will use machine learning to build an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

### 7. [Make Effective Visualization](https://github.com/homagnibhatt/Udacity_Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/tree/master/Project_7_Make_Effective_Data_Visualization)

The project involves creating a data visualization from a data set that tells a story abut the survivors of the Titanic dataset using  dimple.js or d3.js to create the visualization.
